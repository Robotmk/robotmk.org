faq:
  title: 'What often gets asked about Robotmk:'
  questions: 
    - question: 'What do I need to get started with Robotmk and Robot Framework?'
      answer: 'Robotmk has formed the technical foundation of Checkmk Synthetic Monitoring since 2022. Therefore, a Checkmk installation is of course a prerequisite. For small installations and to try out Checkmk, the trial version is sufficient, which can be downloaded [here](https://checkmk.com/download/trial).'
    - question: 'Do I need programming skills to use Robotmk?'
      answer: 'Basic knowledge of Robot Framework is helpful, but the easy-to-understand syntax means that even beginners can quickly become productive. The keyword-driven syntax of Robot Framework is used precisely for the purpose of hiding complex Python code.'
    - question: 'How do I prepare a Windows/Linux host for use as a test host?'
      answer: 'Not at all. The installation packages for the test hosts are created by Checkmk, including configuration, scheduler, robot files and also a sophisticated technology to create the Python runtime environments virtually from scratch.'
    - question: 'How can I test applications via Citrix with Robotmk?'
      answer: 'The Citrix session can initially be set up with a web library, for example. As soon as Citrix starts, a library for screen pattern recognition can be used, which can work completely agnostic of the screen content. RDP sessions can also be tested with this.'
    - question: 'What do I have to do to integrate existing Robot Framework tests?'
      answer: 'No customization is required for the integration of existing robot suites.'
    - question: 'Where can I download Robotmk?'
      answer: 'Robotmk is an integral part of Checkmk and can be downloaded [here](https://checkmk.com/download/trial)'
    - question: 'Who is behind Robotmk?'
      answer: 'Robotmk was developed in 2020 by Simon Meggle (ELABIT GmbH) and initially released as an open source extension for Checkmk. Since 2022, Simon has been working as Product Manager "Synthetic Monitoring" for Checkmk, as well as in his own company as a consultant and trainer for Robotmk and Robot Framework.'
    - question: 'What is the difference between Robotmk and Synthetic Monitoring?'
      answer: 'Synthetic Monitoring is an established technical term for the automated, repeated simulation of user interactions with user interfaces and is also the product name in Checkmk. Robotmk is the name of the specific technical implementation for Checkmk.'
    - question: 'Where can I get professional support?'
      answer: 'Support for Robotmk is provided by [Checkmk](https://checkmk.com) GmbH. Consulting and training for Robotmk and Robot Framework is provided by [ELABIT](https://elabit.de) GmbH. ELABIT has also been an accredited training partner for the [RFCP](https://cert.robotframework.org) exam since 2024.'

It consists of three courses that build on each other, including a Windows/Linux lab environment:  
  

- Course Level 1Ô∏è‚É£ - **Robotmk Synthetic Monitoring Foundation üßæ**:  
  The fastest and safest way to get into synthetic monitoring with Robotmk and Checkmk
- Course Level 2Ô∏è‚É£ - **Robotmk Synthetic Monitoring Advanced üßæ**:  
  Probably the most comprehensive course available on that subject - and probably the only one. Learn directly from the founder of Robotmk!
- Course Level 3Ô∏è‚É£ - **Robotmk Synthetic Monitoring Expert üßæüèÖ**:  
  Technical preparation is not everything you need for a successful implementation of End2End monitoring (I had to learn that too...). In this course you will learn the proper planning, documentation and implementation of synthetic monitoring.  
  This is a feature-rich course based on 9 years of experience.

  
At the end of each course you will receive a certificate of attendance. üßæ  
**Level 3** concludes with the certificate **_"Certified Robotmk Synthetic Monitoring Expert"_**. üèÖ  
Apply now and be notified as soon as the program launches!  
  
**Preregistration Benefits:**  
‚úÖ **Priority access** to course materials.  
‚úÖ Exclusive preregistration discount.  
‚úÖ **Early bird webinar sessions** with the instructor.  
‚úÖ Stay updated with course developments and schedules.  
  
**Anyone** can learn to keep their business applications **available, working and performing** by following this certification system, because it takes you **straight to your goal** without making any detours.
