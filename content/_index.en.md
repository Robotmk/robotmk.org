![What is RobotMK](/images/index/home-introduction-banner-what-is-robotmk.png)

**RobotMK**  contains the names of the two tools  **Robot Framework**  and  **CheckMK**  (for further details see below).

With  **Robot Framework**  you can automatically test programs, web sites (and much more...) from the perspective of the user.

Software developers appreciate this type of tests, as an application can thus for instance be tested swiftly in all its facets and variations before being released in a new version.

It is a great advantage to also have such tests in the monitoring system CheckMK and be able to check continuously...

-   ...whether the login into the CRM system functions – and how long it takes
-   ....whether the search function in the SAP/merchandise management system for randomly selected article numbers works
-   ...how efficiently the ordering process functions in the web shop

...etc...

**So far this possibility has not existed**.

**Now RobotMK creates a bridge and permits the integration of the results of Robot-tests into the monitoring system CheckMK.**

It consists of three courses that build on each other, including a Windows/Linux lab environment:  
  

- Course Level 1️⃣ - **Robotmk Synthetic Monitoring Foundation 🧾**:  
  The fastest and safest way to get into synthetic monitoring with Robotmk and Checkmk
- Course Level 2️⃣ - **Robotmk Synthetic Monitoring Advanced 🧾**:  
  Probably the most comprehensive course available on that subject - and probably the only one. Learn directly from the founder of Robotmk!
- Course Level 3️⃣ - **Robotmk Synthetic Monitoring Expert 🧾🏅**:  
  Technical preparation is not everything you need for a successful implementation of End2End monitoring (I had to learn that too...). In this course you will learn the proper planning, documentation and implementation of synthetic monitoring.  
  This is a feature-rich course based on 9 years of experience.

  
At the end of each course you will receive a certificate of attendance. 🧾  
**Level 3** concludes with the certificate **_"Certified Robotmk Synthetic Monitoring Expert"_**. 🏅  
Apply now and be notified as soon as the program launches!  
  
**Preregistration Benefits:**  
✅ **Priority access** to course materials.  
✅ Exclusive preregistration discount.  
✅ **Early bird webinar sessions** with the instructor.  
✅ Stay updated with course developments and schedules.  
  
**Anyone** can learn to keep their business applications **available, working and performing** by following this certification system, because it takes you **straight to your goal** without making any detours.  
  
PS: If you take part in this learning program, it will not only serve your company, because it can keep its applications available with a powerful tool.  
The certification is also a valuable addition to your own education portfolio that will help you stand out in the job market. 🤫
