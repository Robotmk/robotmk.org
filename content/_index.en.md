- heading: 'Central control via WATO'
  icon : 'fa fa-gears'
  text: '**RobotMK** is configured via a powerful **rule system** in the web administration interface of CheckMK (WATO).'  
- heading: 'Flexible output formatting'
  icon: 'fa fa-crop'
  text: '**RobotMK** evaluates intricately interleaved Robot results; the **pattern-based reduction** of the output to the essential ensures an optimum result.'  
- heading: 'Readability'
  icon: 'fa fa-volume-up'
  text: 'The "**keyword-driven**" approach abstracts complex Python code and can be encapsulated at will – with free name choice. **The result**: traceable results and meaningful messages in the monitoring system.'  
- heading: '100% Robot compatible'
  icon: 'fa fa-handshake-o'
  text: '**RobotMK** does not require any adaptation to existing Robot tests; every Robot test can be integrated in CheckMK **without any intervention**.'  
- heading: 'Performance monitoring'
  icon: 'fa fa-area-chart'
  text: '**RobotMK can monitor runtimes** at any level, be it whole suites, tests and keywords. (Or how would you detect an insidious login time increase by 0.1s per month?)'  
- heading: 'Worthwhile addition to CheckMK'
  icon: 'fa fa-binoculars'
  text: '**Checkmk** can only monitor up to **OSI layer 7**. Robotmk completes your monitoring with a detailled view inside applications to get a holistic view of services and their quality.'
- heading: 'Swiss army knife'
  icon: 'fa fa-book'
  text: "The **Library concept** makes Robot Framework the **Suisse pocket knife**. You'll find a library for nearly any use case. And you are free to use them combined in a test." 
- heading:   'Strong community'
  icon: 'fa fa-comments-o'
  text: 'Great if you have backed the right horse, in case help is required: CheckMK and Robot have a worldwide, English speaking community at their disposal.'  
- heading:   'Platform-independent'
  icon: 'fa fa-arrows-alt'
  text: 'One for all: Robot Framework works for all common platforms: Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, ... including the appropriate test libraries in each case (e.g. Auto-IT for Windows automation).'  
- heading: '100% Open Source'
  icon: 'fa fa-unlock'
  text: 'RobotMK - like Robot Framework and CheckMK Raw – is published as an Open Source project. No hidden costs, no vendor-lock-in.'

![What is RobotMK](/images/index/home-introduction-banner-what-is-robotmk.png)

**RobotMK**  contains the names of the two tools  **Robot Framework**  and  **CheckMK**  (for further details see below).

With  **Robot Framework**  you can automatically test programs, web sites (and much more...) from the perspective of the user.

Software developers appreciate this type of tests, as an application can thus for instance be tested swiftly in all its facets and variations before being released in a new version.

It is a great advantage to also have such tests in the monitoring system CheckMK and be able to check continuously...

-   ...whether the login into the CRM system functions – and how long it takes
-   ....whether the search function in the SAP/merchandise management system for randomly selected article numbers works
-   ...how efficiently the ordering process functions in the web shop

...etc...

**So far this possibility has not existed**.

**Now RobotMK creates a bridge and permits the integration of the results of Robot-tests into the monitoring system CheckMK.**
