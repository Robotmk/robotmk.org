**Munich Airport, Terminal 2, Gate K10** ‚Äì I use the time before my flight to study the agenda for Robocon 2025 in more detail.

üëâ This year's topics are truly amazing!  


<!--more-->

## Robocon ‚Äì a brief overview  

**Robocon** ([https://robocon.io](https://robocon.io)) is the leading international conference on Robot Framework.  
It takes place in Helsinki every year and is organized by the **Robot Framework Foundation**, the non-profit organization behind the project.  

The event offers a great mix of **high-quality talks, lightning talks and interactive workshops**.  
The conference is aimed at both beginners and experienced users of Robot Framework.  

**It's a great opportunity** to gain new insights, learn about best practices and talk to other test automation experts.  

## Why I'm particularly looking forward to Robocon 2025  

Of course, I look forward to this event every year ‚Äì but this time is particularly special.  
Not only because the agenda is packed with **interesting topics** (see below), but also because this year sees the introduction of the **first official certification** for Robot Framework called ‚Äú**RFCP**‚Äù üèÖ (Robot Framework Certified Professional).  

I had the honor of being part of the working group that developed the syllabus for the RFCP.  
The introduction of this certification is a milestone for the community and a big step towards further establishing Robot Framework as a professional test automation solution.  
I am proud to be one of the first accredited trainers and look forward to holding my first training sessions soon. (Hello Munich, I'm looking forward to it! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

But now to the real highlight: the most exciting topics at this year's Robocon.  

---

### AI and self-healing tests  

It is clear to see that **AI is slowly coming of age in the Robot Framework ecosystem**.  

Several talks are dedicated to this topic ‚Äì a sign that automation and machine learning are becoming increasingly intertwined.  

I am particularly looking forward to the following sessions:  

"**Make Automation Green Again ‚Äì Experiments with AI supported self-healing**"

Here, **Many Kasiriha** will show how AI can help to **automatically repair failing tests during execution**. 

(Many's talks are legendary in the community ‚Äì his way of getting to the heart of complex topics regularly prompts reactions along the lines of **‚ÄúMore of that!‚Äù** üòä  ) 

"**Appium Self-healing for RobotFramework AppiumLibrary**"

Mobile Testing on **iOS and Android** is an area that I definitely want to include in my training program in the medium term.  

The ability to integrate **self-healing test mechanisms** directly into the AppiumLibrary could alleviate many of the typical challenges in mobile testing.  
Because one thing I know from my own experience: mobile UI tests are often a real challenge ‚Äì especially when debugging.

"**Dear AI, Which Tests should Robot Framework Execute Now?**"

The title alone sounds promising.  
**Elmar J√ºrgens** will show how AI can help to select specifically those tests that are most likely to find the next bug from an ever-increasing number of tests.  

A solution that not only saves testing time but could also significantly increase the efficiency of test automation.  

"**Redefining Automation with Robot Freamework: Harnessing AI, LLMs, and Custom Libraries for Next-Gen Testing**"

This is guaranteed to be exciting! **Siddhant Wadhwani** will show in a **live demo** how **AI and LLMs can be used in custom libraries** ‚Äì including for self-healing tests and real-time test analysis.  

**My conclusion in advance:** 

AI will also be a **game changer** in test automation ‚Äì *and this is just the beginning*.

### DevOps & CI/CD 

As a long-time **Ansible user**, when I think of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, I naturally think of provisioning on-prem servers. But there are many more exciting possibilities, as Nils Balkow-Tychsen will show in his talk: 

"**Infrastructure as Code ‚Äì Yet another super power for your test automation**"

Nils has developed a library for OpenTofu (the open-source fork of Terraform).  

This means that Robot Framework can not only execute tests, but also dynamically set up and tear down its own test infrastructure! Very cool!

---

### Performance and load testing  

Two talks are dedicated to performance testing ‚Äì an area that is often underestimated:  

"**Utilizing RF Swarm to Execute Performance Testing on PostgreSQL Database Upgrade**"

**Omoghomion Oredia** will show how he used **RF Swarm to test a PostgreSQL migration on AWS**.  

This is a practical example that shows how Robot Framework can be used for more than just functional testing.  

"**Perfbot ‚Äì Integrated performance analysis of robot tests**"

I am particularly looking forward to this talk by Lennart Potthoff because of my secondary role as Product Manager for Robotmk at Checkmk.

Performance measurements and historical recordings are **essential features of Robotmk** for permanently monitoring Robot Framework tests. Perhaps Perfbot can be integrated into **Synthetic Monitoring with Robotmk**?  


---

### UI Testing  

"**Robot Framework to the Rescue: Replacing EggPlant with a Custom UI-Test Library**"

Wow! Finally, something is happening in the area of UI testing.

The **PlatynUI library** is a **cross-platform desktop UI automation library** that promises to be a real alternative to existing solutions such as **ImageHorizonLibrary**.  

üëâ Will the PlatynUI library become my new favorite library? I'm excited!  üòâ 

---

## Summary  

The **agenda** for Robocon 2025 shows clear trends:  

1. **AI** is increasingly being combined with test automation ‚Äì **self-healing, predictive testing & LLMs** are on the rise.  
2. Mobile test automation with **AppiumLibrary** is moving more into focus (and is also gradually becoming usable...)  
3. Robot Framework is definitely also more and more important for **DevOps** & CI/CD topics.
4. Old tools are being replaced by new solutions, **adding value to the Robot Framework ecosystem**: EggPlant ‚Üí Robot Framework, Terraform ‚Üí OpenTofu. ‚≠êÔ∏è 

---

## Conclusion & outlook  

Robocon 2025 will definitely be a highlight ‚Äì not only because of the exciting topics, but also because of the great community.  
I am looking forward to exchanging ideas with like-minded people, the latest developments in the Robot Framework ecosystem and, of course, a few days in Helsinki. 

**...boarding time! üí∫**

P.S.: Guess who is stupid enough to fly to Helsinki in February without a hat üòÇ
