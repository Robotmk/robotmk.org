The sunny spring weather actually invited us to spend the day outdoors, but Animesh and I persevered: a day of recording 🎙️ 🎥 in the Checkmk studio in the heart of Munich.

The first steps with Robotmk and Robot Framework in particular can be a bit tough (I know that from personal experience...).  
So it's time to combat this and help beginners overcome these initial hurdles with a series of tutorial videos.  
With this in mind, I met with Animesh yesterday at the Checkmk studio in the "Au" district of central Munich.  

Animesh is not only responsible for all video productions at Checkmk, but also takes care of social media and ensures that the [Checkmk conference](https://conference.checkmk.com) can be followed online not only in Munich, but all over the world.

The first video was about the basics of Robot Framework.  
After a short introduction to Robot Framework and Robotmk, I created a simple web test live: Calling up Google search, clicking away the cookie banner, executing a search and checking the result.  
And as a cherry on top 🍒, I integrate a screenshot of the exact page section in which Robotmk appears!

The second video shows the integration of this web test in Checkmk with the help of Robotmk.  

Many thanks here to Animesh. He sat at the editing desk with the patience of an angel and now has the challenging task of cutting ✂️ my stumbling English into a clearly understandable tutorial 😉.

This recording session is just the beginning to a series of further videos on [Checkmk's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@checkmk-channel) - more to follow!

And soon the time will come: I'm currently working intensively on finalising the **Level 1 online course** on Synthetic Monitoring with Robotmk.  

Look forward to it - more on this soon!
